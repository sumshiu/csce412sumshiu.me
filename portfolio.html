                <p>Young people who struggle to manage their finances effectively can feel overwhelmed which 
                    leads to poor decisions. We got inspired by cat-collecting mobile games. We wanted to create 
                    a product that users will develop good finance habits but also make the experience interactive 
                    and fun. By adding game elements, we incentivize the user to stick to their goals to reward them 
                    for creating smart habits but also consider saving and sticking to a budget for enjoyable activities. 
                    An application that analyzes users' expenses and transactions to create an effective budget and savings 
                    plan to help them manage their finances more efficiently. If the user completes the goals, they get points 
                    to be able to purchase cats and cat accessories through a randomized character system. </p>

                <p>FloSTEM, a web application, sprouts students' curiosity and excitement in STEM through a pixelated fantasy-themed 
                    assessment. In this assessment, the user answers various questions. Each answer choice contains specific attributes 
                    that will determine which STEM category best fits the student. Through this event, my team and I organized our project 
                    attentively, which led us to discover how to apply the Database First Approach, reverse engineer a database, and 
                    intertwine an algorithm to front-end development. Furthermore, this project was inspired by Hogwarts Houses, so 
                    each letter in STEM represents a “house” for the user to receive. The “house” indicates what fields of STEM the 
                    user is closely related to and may choose to explore more about the field they got from the assessment. For 
                    example, if the user got Math at the end of the quiz, their interests are closely aligned to careers with math. </p>
