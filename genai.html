        <h2>History of Energy Drinks & Abraham Lincoln</h2>
        <p>Energy drinks have an interesting history, tracing back to the early 1900s. Initially, they were developed to provide an extra boost of energy, often using ingredients like caffeine, taurine, and sugar. The market truly expanded in the 1980s with the introduction of brands like Red Bull, which popularized the modern concept of energy drinks.</p>
        <p>These drinks have been controversial, with debates about their effects on health. While they can enhance alertness and performance, excessive consumption has led to concerns about heart health and addiction. Despite this, the energy drink industry continues to thrive, adapting to trends by introducing sugar-free and natural ingredient alternatives.</p>
        <p>Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, is widely regarded as one of the greatest leaders in American history. His leadership during the Civil War, his role in ending slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation, and his dedication to preserving the Union solidified his legacy. His speeches, like the Gettysburg Address, are still studied today for their profound impact.</p>
        <p>Lincoln’s ability to navigate the country through one of its darkest periods with intelligence and empathy set him apart from other leaders. His assassination in 1865 was a tragic loss, but his vision of a united and free America lived on, shaping future generations.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, both energy drinks and Abraham Lincoln have left significant marks in history—one in the world of consumables and the other in leadership. While energy drinks continue to fuel people worldwide, Lincoln’s ideals continue to inspire and guide leaders today.</p>

        <h2>The Bear on a Bicycle</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, deep in a mystical forest, there lived a bear named Bruno. But Bruno was no ordinary bear—he had a peculiar talent. Every afternoon, he would ride his bright red bicycle through the trees while juggling three perfectly round blue balls.</p>
        <p>Animals of all kinds gathered to watch this magnificent spectacle. The squirrels cheered, the rabbits clapped, and even the wise old owl gave an approving nod. "How does he do it?" they wondered.</p>
        <p>One day, a gust of wind tried to throw Bruno off balance, but with perfect coordination, he steadied himself and kept juggling. The crowd erupted in applause, knowing they had witnessed something truly magical.</p>

        <h2>Original Prompt</h2>
        <p>Make a HTML and CSS page with a fancy navbar that navigates to the home page, qualifications page, portfolio page, service page, and another for genai.html. All the pages are HTML files. Talk about the history of energy drinks and how Abraham Lincoln is the best president. This discussion will be 5 paragraphs long with 400 words in total. Furthermore, there will be a story about a bear riding a bicycle while juggling 3 blue balls. Also, there will be a box made to show this exact prompt. I would like this page to be a light blue theme. Be creative.</p>
